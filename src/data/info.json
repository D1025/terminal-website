Our single goal is to deliver the best FOnline server ever created while putting players first. We do not monetise the game; development is driven purely by fun and the desire to reach the highest quality possible.\n\n**Why choose our server?** Because we focus on innovative mechanics, fair play and rigorous balance. Expect a combat-oriented experience where thoughtful decisions matter and randomness is minimised – the best player, not the luckiest dice roll, should win."

At that stage every class is immediately available and you automatically receive every perk required for **100 %** combat efficiency. Of course, nothing stops you from levelling further if you want additional progression."

In-game you can only raise skills temporarily; changing SPECIAL later will instantly and proportionally adjust the underlying skills. SPECIAL also defines which perks your character is eligible to pick."
